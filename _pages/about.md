Hi there! üòÉ

My name is Ali and I'm an M.Sc. candidate at the [University of Montr√©al][UdeM] & [Mila][Mila] supervised by [Prof. Liam Paull][lp] at the [Montreal Robotics and Embodied AI Lab][mlab]. My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics. Checkout my work on constructing awesome scene representations for robots [here][cf].

**I am currently actively seeking out internship/full-time opportunities for the summer of 2023, and beyond. You can take a look at my resume [here][cv]. If you'd like to get in touch, please don't hesitate to email me at alihusein.kuwajerwala@x, x=umontreal.ca**

Previously, I completed an internship at the [Alexa AI][aai] team at [Amazon][amzn], where I worked on using large language models for querying databases. In between my undergrad and master's I was a student researcher at the [Robot, Vision and Learning Lab][RVL] at the [University of Toronto][uoft] supervised by [Prof. Florian Shkurti][flo] where I worked on [visual navigation for mobile robots][eq]. I've also worked in software engineering roles at [Epson][epsn] and [Liquid Analytics][la].

My undergrad was at the [Univeristy of Toronto][uoft] where I studied CS & Math, and also worked as a Teaching Assistant. During my time there I was co-founder of the [UTM Robotics Club][utmr], and a recpient of the [NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award][na].

I've also worked on a few fun coding projects which you can look at via my [github profile][gh].

When I'm not staring at a screen all day, you can find me training jiu-jitsu, listening to audiobooks and podcasts, doodling, and/or chatting with wonderful people on my [podcast][pd]. ‚úåÔ∏è
